# Shield Status 

This is an LCD script mod that adds a shield readout for Defense Shields. It is NOT compatible with Energy Shields as, 
although I loved that mod back in the day, I haven't used it in years.

## Features 

- Current shield status (up, down, overloaded) 
- Current shield HP% 
- Current shield heat% 
- Max shield HP 
- Doesn't require a PB 


### Comparison to [(THYA) Shield HUD Script](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543765745)

- \+ Doesn't need a PB 
- \+ Client-side only 
- \+ More information (e.g. heat) 
- \+ Nicer looking (IMO) 
- \+ Less setup needed
- \- Less customisable 
- \- Less display options 
- \- Mod rather than script
